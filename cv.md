## Ð¡oncerning me

I am 22 years old and I enjoy sports, astrophysics and neural networks. Since my school days, I have had a passion for programming and computer science. At the moment, I am exploring the world of frontend development and sometimes I regret not starting earlier. Now, I need to learn much more in order to keep up with the competition. The brain can be resistant to forming new neural connections, so I have set myself a goal to complete this course successfully.

## Skills
* Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, Kotlin
* Editors and libraries: React, Node.js, Django
* Methods: Agile, Scrum
